<h3>
  Pacific Islanders have always been on the forefront of combatting climate change. This thesis project invites your voices in to grow Marshallese power in the digital and real world through putting Marshallese perspectives in a public forum.
The project aims to highlight both Marshallese history and leadership in this global crisis, but also as a space for imagining what a pacific future would look like in a world without nuclear experimentation, climate change, and US militarism.
This graduate thesis project can also be done in a range of group settings, including university classes, youth workshops, or just between a group of friends. Use this site as a tool to advocate an Oceania that can one day be free from anthropogenic climate change that contemporary empires are responsible of.
