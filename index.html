        About The Project
      </h1>
      <h3>
        This platform is a vessel for research, reflection, and growth
        surrounding Marshall Islands' monumental efforts to combat the climate
        crisis for the world. Structured much as an atlas, here you are invited
        explore a series of visualizations of Marshall Island's history,
        progression, and activism concerning the global climate crisis.
        <!----This
        thesis platform has 3 main sections, with additional resources where you
        can conntect or contribute to local resources. ---->
      </h3>
      <p>
        In 2015, Marshall Islands made its name in fighting for a more
        progressive Paris Agreement. Since then, RMI has declared a national
        climate crisis and continues to play an outsized role in the global
        fight for keeping global warming under 1.5°C. Whilst the various
        campaigns focus on the level of challenge for islanders to overcome this
        crisis, it is important to recognize the role optimism towards Pacific
        culture and resilience plays in this fight. A unique history of fighting
        for nuclear justice and an abundance of global-local activism puts
        Marshall Islands at the forefront. <br /><br />What would it look like
        to map hopes and dreams of a better future amidst our current climate?
        Can mapping optimism and resilience from Marshallese communities reshape
        how the world thinks about—and act about—the climate crisis?

        Who created this platform?
      </h1>
      <p>
        My name is Ching-Yu Daniel Chu, a Taiwanese graduate student currently
        at Parsons School of Design in New York. I created this project as part
        of my MS degree thesis. I landed in this cause initially when
        researching the formation of Marshallese communities in the United
        States, focusing on history, causations, and trends in Northwest
        Arkansas. <br /><br />I would like to create a story-based map which
        illustrates riMajel relationships with climate and environment. The hope
        is that the answers from the community can help reframe global
        perceptions of climate crisis not only on scientific facts but also its
        human impacts, and put Marshallese communities at the forefront of both
        global challenges and solutions. This form functions as a space for
        gathering responses form the Marshallese community to highlight your
        intimacy with nature past, present, and future. <br /><br />The
        following pages will contain questions about you, your beliefs, and
        positions. The public facing part of the project will ask you to submit
        a media file of any kind with accompanying descriptions and geography.
        You are not obligated to answer all questions, but only those that you
        feel comfortable with. I would encourage you to take some time with your
        answers if possible. The stories you share will be illustrated in an
        interactive map. Please be mindful that information you shared could be
        shared publicly unless otherwise noted or requested. The map will be
        published on a web platform along with an atlas depicting Marshallese
        history in relation with society and environment, and where the current
        fights against this crisis stand, all of which are part of my thesis
        project.

        Disclaimer
      </h1>
      <p>
        I am not Marshallese and have yet to visit the Marshall Islands. The
        research works conducted throughout the project is through a combination
        of literature/media reviews, attendance at online
        presentations/conferences, talking with some community members, etc,
        during various levels of lockdown and quarantine in New York City. As a
        fellow citizen of the Pacific, I stand in solidarity with all
        independence and decolonial movements from Okinawa to Aotearoa to
        Hawai'i. I also recognize that the API community is not a monolith as
        seen and presented where I reside. I hope this project can work to
        highlight and elevate the importance of Pacific Islanders within the US
        context. Although this work tackles more climate-side of issues, I want
        to make the larger political intentions of Pacific solidarity and
        sovereignty clear. When it is finally safe to travel post-pandemic, I
        hope to return to our ocean and be one of the first on a flight to
        Majro!<br /><br /> In addition, I also acknowledge the incredible pain and suffering
        Covid-19 has brought to the Pacific Islander communities. There are
        arguably more urgent concerns to deal with at the moment, especially for
        many Marshallese families that live in the US. There is no pressure to
        participate in this survey. What and how you answer the prompts are all
        in your control and subject to your changes at any time. You have always
        hold all rights with the information you share. I am immensely honored
        to be able to share and hopefully amplify Marshallese voices in any way.
